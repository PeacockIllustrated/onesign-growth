**OneSign Digital – Design Team Brief**

**Project:** Launch / Scale / Dominate Digital Growth Packages

**Purpose:** Create a clear, premium, sales-ready visual system for OneSign’s digital retainers and add-on services.

---

**1\. PROJECT OVERVIEW**

OneSign is launching a **productised digital growth service** alongside signage, aimed at:

* Existing signage clients (upsell)  
* New clients who need demand generation  
* Larger partners (retail, construction, frameworks)

The goal is to:

* Create **recurring monthly revenue (ARR)**

This design work will be used for:

* Sales meetings  
* Proposals  
* Website landing pages  
* PDF leave-behinds  
* Email follow-ups

---

**2\. BRAND & TONE DIRECTION**

**Overall Feel**

* Confident  
* Commercial  
* Outcome-driven  
* Premium but practical (not “agency fluff”)

**Avoid**

* Trendy marketing clichés  
* Overly creative visuals that obscure clarity  
* Stock “digital marketing” imagery (charts, laptops, random people)

**Lean into**

* Structure  
* Simplicity  
* Authority  
* Business growth language
