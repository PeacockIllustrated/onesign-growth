# Signage & Wayfinding: A Design-Led Approach for Architects

## Strapline

Supporting design intent from concept to construction

---

## Introduction

Signage and wayfinding should feel like a natural extension of the architecture — not an overlay applied late in the process.

When resolved early and properly, it supports clarity, movement and identity without compromising design quality.

We work alongside architects to help translate design intent into build-ready signage that delivers exactly as drawn.

---

## What Matters to Architects

From working with design teams across public realm, heritage, education and mixed-use projects, we consistently see the same priorities:

- Protecting design intent
- Materials and proportions that align with the architecture
- Details that are buildable, not theoretical
- Clean coordination with façades, interiors, landscape and MEP
- Planning-ready solutions, especially in sensitive contexts
- Avoiding late-stage compromise or value-engineering

---

## Where Signage Often Goes Wrong

Despite best intentions, signage is often:

- Considered too late in the programme
- Value-engineered without design input
- Poorly fixed, damaging façades or finishes
- Challenged at planning or conservation stage
- Visually cluttered or inconsistent
- Delivered differently to what was drawn

These issues usually arise from a lack of early technical resolution rather than design quality.

## How We Support Design Teams

Our role is to bridge the gap between concept and construction:

- Early input on signage strategy and placement
- Advice on materials, finishes and fixing methods
- Planning-ready visuals and proportions
- Technical detailing at RIBA Stages 4–5
- Build-ready packages contractors can deliver accurately
- Close coordination through fabrication and installation

The goal is simple: what's designed is what gets built.

## How We Typically Engage

We can support at any stage — formally or informally:

- Early concept sanity-checks
- Design development and detailing
- Planning and heritage support
- Technical packages for tender and construction
- Delivery support through to installation

No obligation. Just support where it adds value.

## Mini Case Study: Design → Detail → Delivery

### Project Context

Complex public-facing environment requiring clear wayfinding without visual clutter, delivered within a sensitive architectural setting.

### Design Intent

The signage needed to:

- Sit quietly within the architecture
- Respect material language and proportions
- Support intuitive movement without over-signage

The architectural intent was minimal, legible and integrated.

### Technical Resolution

Working alongside the design team, we:

- Developed material-appropriate signage details
- Resolved fixing methods that protected surrounding finishes
- Coordinated with façade, interior and MEP packages
- Produced technical drawings aligned with the architectural set

All details were agreed before procurement.

### Delivery

- Fabrication followed the approved architectural details
- Installation aligned with site sequencing
- No design compromise during value-engineering
- Final installation matched the original intent

The result was signage that felt considered, purposeful and part of the architecture — not applied to it.

### Key Takeaway

Early technical resolution protects design quality and avoids downstream compromise.

## Materials & Detail Reference Sheet

### Purpose

A quick reference for how signage can be integrated cleanly within architectural environments.

### Typical Materials

Selected based on context, durability and visual restraint:

- Powder-coated steel
- Stainless steel (brushed or bead-blasted)
- Brass / bronze (natural or patinated)
- Aluminium (anodised or coated)
- Timber and composite interfaces
- Stone and masonry-compatible systems

All materials are selected to age appropriately and perform long-term.

### Fixing Principles

Resolved to protect the architecture:

- Concealed fixings where possible
- Face-fix only where architecturally appropriate
- Stand-off systems to protect façades
- Freestanding elements to avoid fabric impact
- Removable systems for maintenance and future change

Fixings are designed as part of the detail — not an afterthought.

### Illumination (Where Required)

Used sparingly and purposefully:

- Discreet halo or edge illumination
- Low-glare, low-maintenance LED systems
- Integrated power routing coordinated with MEP
- No illumination where it detracts from the architecture

### Performance Considerations

- Durability in high-traffic environments
- Ease of maintenance and replacement
- Planning and conservation sensitivity
- Long-term visual consistency

### Final Note

Good signage doesn't draw attention to itself — it supports clarity, movement and identity while allowing the architecture to lead.
